# 🚀 100 Days of Python - Angela Yu  

This repository contains my progress and solutions for the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by **Angela Yu**. Each day includes Python scripts, exercises, and mini-projects to improve my coding skills.  

## 📂 Structure  
Each day has its own folder with:  
- **Python scripts (`.py`)** for daily challenges  
- **Notes (`README.md`)** summarizing key concepts (optional)  

## 🚀 Goal  
To complete **100 days of Python** and build real-world projects!
